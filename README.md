### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! 

My name is AndrÃ© and I am a full stack developer with a previous career in business, that allows me to translate business needs to the technology world.

I am also a web development teacher focused on trying to make the web easier for the my students

I have had the fortune of working with clients in the United States, Germany, Portugal, and Wales.

Most of my clients have been focused on e-commerce. Wether to create a store from scratch or redesigning previous stores with new technology stacks and platforms.
